## Overall

I'll never have any practical use for this, so call it done?


## To do

- Handle events (start with keys). (Switch to SDL first.) (Poll stdin.)


## Maybe

- Don't draw things that are below the page?
- Startup: find path, find pid, make dir, fork.
- Clean up code organisation. (Getting there. Not thread-safe, but neat.)
